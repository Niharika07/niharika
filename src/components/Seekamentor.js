            <p>India is a country with a <strong>population of 1.38 billion</strong> and a <strong>literacy rate of 74.4%</strong>, however, only <strong>37% of students have access to mentorship</strong>.
              One major reason is that only the top tier colleges, which are ~1% of the total colleges in India, have access to quality mentorship from industry leaders and experts; leaving a majority of students to resort to platforms like LinkedIn, which are not even primarily focused on mentorship.</p>
            <p Style="color:#5A5A6C">The concept of mentorship is <strong>not new to India</strong> - from mythology to history, every major figure had a mentor to guide them down the path of excellence.</p>

              <h5>Tackling the problem</h5> <p>The ecosystem of mentorship primarily consists of mentors and mentees. We began our process with <strong>Secondary Research</strong> where we understood the <strong>context of the problem</strong> we were solving.</p>
              <p>This was followed by <strong>Primary Research </strong>phase where we conducted <strong>a survey and 30 semi-structured user interviews</strong>.</p>

              <h5 Style="padding-top:3rem;">Research Synthesis</h5>
              <p> Our process was focused to <strong>understand the pain points and motivations</strong> faced by the mentors as well as the mentees to identify key insights. I <strong>conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 mentors and 15 mentees</strong> who were interested in the mentorship platform. Then I created an <strong>affinity map to cluster similar themes</strong> together and <strong>identify user needs</strong>.  </p>
