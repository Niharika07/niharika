          <p>For the safety and privacy of the application, it will be referred to as Access Management System. I worked with a team of 2 Backend developers, a Business Analyst, a Scrum Master and a Product owner.</p>


          <h5 className="projectTopic">Background</h5>
          <p>During Summerâ€™2020 I was developing the Front-end as part of modernizing a legacy application, called Access Management System for my client - a leading bank based out of Netherlands, when I realized how the interface lacked interactivity and usability. 
            Several heuristic violations were observed. Sooner than later, I took the responsibility of redesigning the application.


          <h5 className="projectTopic">Understanding the problem</h5>
            Access Management System is an application that was developed 20 years ago. It allowed employees of the bank to manage the Means of Access which the customers have with the bank.</p>
          <p><strong>Means of Access are ways through which a person can access their bank account.</strong> The 3 Means of Access which the customers have are:
            <Image src={access} Style="padding-top:3rem;padding-bottom:3rem;" fluid />
            Being one of the financial institutions focused on user-centric design, there were many issues with the application. Some of them being :
           <p> 1. Several Heuristics violations - 
              <ul><li>Human limitations - There was too many operations that a user had to perform on one screen which increased their cognitive load.</li>
              <li>Human limitations - There was too many operations that a user had to perform on one screen which increased their cognitive load.</li>
              <li>Human limitations - There was too many operations that a user had to perform on one screen which increased their cognitive load.</li>
               </ul></p>
               <p>  2. Low task success rate - for a first time user, it was extremely difficult to successfully complete a task without regular support from fellow employees. </p>
          <p>  3. High task completion time - since the application was 20 years old, there were too many unnecessary steps that a user had to go through to complete a task. </p>
	   <p> 4. High error rates - since the font was too small, users always ended up clicking on wrong information, leading to high error rates with the application.</p>

          <h5 className="projectTopic">Research</h5>
          <p>I first reached out to the product owner to understand the existing application.
            Then, I took a survey and held semi-structured interviews with the users of the application to understand their pain-points and frustrations with the application.
          </p><p> The survey was created in a way to understand <strong>how frequently the application will be used</strong> and what all <strong>features must be covered</strong> in the solution along with the <strong>priority of each feature to inform our Product Roadmap</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>To further understand the problem space, I organised meetings with IT operations team to study the incidents they received from the existing application. These meetings turned out to be insightful since I discovered a common frustration in them - <b>bad user experience</b>. </p>

          <p>The time when we bid our final goodbyes. Even though it was virtual, it felt the closest we were since we had come full circle. No one was as sad as Ed's cat(she's right in the center). This picture is a testament of the values and bond we shared as a team and the amazing milestones we achieved together. I'm forever grateful for learning how Empathy at Work can bring a huge difference in our day-to-day lives. </p>
